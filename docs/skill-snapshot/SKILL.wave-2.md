  Autonomous agent that resolves all open GitHub issues by planning them into
  dependency-aware parallel execution waves using git worktrees and sub-agents.
  Use when the user asks to fix all issues, resolve open issues, run a wave,

  or worktree-based issue batching.

# GitHub Wave Orchestrator

Resolves all open GitHub issues via parallel execution waves. Each wave groups
independent issues (no shared files), spawns sub-agents in isolated worktrees,
monitors CI, merges PRs, then proceeds to the next wave.

## Quick Start

```
0. Pre-flight     →  verify gh auth, worktrees/ writable
1. Discover       →  gh issue list --json number,title,body,labels
2. Plan waves     →  node scripts/wave-planner.js < issues.json
3. Execute waves  →  worktree → implement → PR → CI → merge → cleanup
4. Repeat until all issues are resolved
```

**Flags:**
- `--auto` — skip Phase 2 confirmation, proceed directly to wave execution. Wave plan is written to state file for auditability.
- `--state-file <path>` — override the default state-file location (issue #3145). The default is `../worktrees/wave-state.<repo-slug>.json`; pass an explicit path when running concurrent orchestrators against the same repo or when migrating away from the legacy `wave-state.json`. Equivalent env var: `WAVE_STATE_FILE=<path>`.
- `--force` — bypass the per-repo pre-flight collision check (issue #3145). By default the orchestrator refuses to overwrite a state file that belongs to a different repo. Use only when you intentionally want to clobber a prior run.

## Phase 0: Pre-flight

```bash
gh auth status                              # Must be authenticated
git fetch origin develop                    # Base branch must be current
mkdir -p ../worktrees && touch ../worktrees/.test && rm ../worktrees/.test  # Writable
```

If any check fails, stop and report to the user.

**Per-repo state-file collision check (issue #3145).** The default state-file
path is namespaced per repo (e.g. `../worktrees/wave-state.fluxion.json`) so
concurrent orchestrator runs against different repos do not overwrite each
other. Before writing the initial state file the orchestrator must verify
the file does not already belong to a different repo:

```bash
source scripts/wave-state-helpers.sh
STATE_FILE=$(get_state_file)
if ! check_state_collision "$STATE_FILE"; then
  echo "ERROR: state file $STATE_FILE belongs to a different repo." >&2
  echo "  Use --state-file to choose a different path, or pass --force to overwrite." >&2
  exit 1
fi
```

`scripts/wave-state-helpers.sh` emits a deprecation warning and falls back to
the legacy `../worktrees/wave-state.json` path for one release when the
namespaced file does not exist. See [REFERENCE.md — Resume and Recovery](REFERENCE.md#resume-and-recovery)
for the resolution policy.

## Phase 1: Discovery

```bash
gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,assignees
```

Filter out issues that are:
- Assigned to someone else (unless unassigned)
- Blocked by a label (e.g., `blocked`, `on-hold`)
- Already linked to an open PR (`gh pr list --search "fixes #N"`)

## Phase 2: Wave Planning

```bash
gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body,labels \
  | node ~/.agents/skills/github-wave-orchestrator/scripts/wave-planner.js [--mix-rule]
```

Pass `--mix-rule` only for repos that track a `milestone` label on
scorecard-moving issues (the fluxion v1.3 throughput program); see the
wave-mix rule below.

Pass `--state-file <path>` (or set `WAVE_STATE_FILE`) to write the plan to
a non-default location; otherwise the plan is written to the per-repo
namespaced state file (`../worktrees/wave-state.<repo-slug>.json`, e.g.
`wave-state.fluxion.json`). The wave-planner refuses to overwrite a state
file that belongs to a different repo unless `--force` is passed.

**Wave-mix rule (default: AUTO).** Every scheduled wave reserves >=1 issue
labeled `milestone`; hygiene issues fill the remaining slots. The planner
colors milestone issues first and milestone issues land one-per-wave (they
share the `milestone` label, so the #369 label-overlap heuristic already
forces the split) — the no-shared-files grouping is preserved; the mix rule
never overrides the conflict graph. Waves that would contain zero milestone
issues are NOT scheduled: their issues are reported in `plan.deferred`
(reason `wave-mix`). When the plan reports deferred issues, HALT before
executing any further wave and notify the user that milestone-compatible
supply is exhausted — never silently fill the pipeline with hygiene.
Modes (recorded in `plan._meta.mix_rule_mode`): **AUTO** (the default, no
flags) enforces the rule whenever >=1 milestone-labeled issue exists and
goes DORMANT (legacy planning + a `WAVE-MIX DORMANT` stderr note) when none
do — repos without a `milestone` label convention are unaffected; surface
dormancy to the user when it persists across runs, since sustained
dormancy means the pipeline is burning hygiene only. **STRICT**
(`--mix-rule` / `WAVE_MIX_RULE=1`) additionally halts the planner itself
with exit code 3 and a `WAVE-MIX HALT` message (no state file written)
when milestone supply is absent entirely; surface that halt to the user
the same way. **OFF** (`--no-mix-rule` / `WAVE_MIX_RULE=0`) disables the
rule for a deliberate hygiene-only run.

**Confirmation & Decision Protocol:**
- If `--auto` flag is passed: proceed immediately (no confirmation required).
- Otherwise: **Consult the Foreman MCP first** via `ask_foreman` before prompting the human:
  - `question`: "Approve execution plan for wave sequence ({wave_count} waves, {issue_count} issues)?"
  - `options`: ["Approve plan and begin wave execution", "Re-plan waves with different parameters", "Halt and escalate to human"]
  - `context`: Summary of planned waves, issues per wave, and milestone mix status.
  - If Foreman returns `status: "answered"`: proceed immediately according to `choice` without interrupting the human.
  - If Foreman returns `status: "abstained"` (or is unavailable): present the plan to the human user and wait for manual confirmation.

The wave plan is written to the state file (`../worktrees/wave-state.<repo-slug>.json`) under the `waves` key for auditability, regardless of confirmation mode.

## Phase 3: Wave Execution (per wave)

**Precondition — nightly-authority check at wave start.** If the target
repo delegates authority checks to scheduled nightly workflows on develop
(e.g. fluxion under ADR-0016), run Checkpoint 1 of
[Nightly-Authority Merge Freeze](#nightly-authority-merge-freeze) before
starting the wave: if ANY lane-3 workflow's most recent COMPLETED run on
develop is `failure`, the wave does not start — run the freeze protocol
instead.

For each issue in the current wave:

### 3a. Worktree Setup

```bash
git worktree add ../worktrees/issue-{N}-{slug} -b fix/issue-{N}-{slug} develop
```

**Skill-snapshot copy rule (issue #379).** When this wave's sub-agent
modifies files in the skill home
(`~/.config/opencode/skill/github-wave-orchestrator/`), each modified file
is copied into the worktree under a **wave-numbered** snapshot name:

```bash
WAVE=$(jq -r .current_wave ../worktrees/wave-state.<repo-slug>.json)
mkdir -p docs/skill-snapshot
cp ~/.config/opencode/skill/github-wave-orchestrator/SKILL.md \
   "docs/skill-snapshot/SKILL.wave-${WAVE}.md"
```

1. **Numbered names only — never the bare basename.** The snapshot path
   is always `<basename>.wave-${WAVE}.md` (e.g. `SKILL.wave-11.md`). Waves
   in one cycle branch from a shared pre-merge develop, so two
   skill-touching waves writing the same path collide add/add (or
   modify/modify) at rebase — the 2026-08-20 failure where waves 1-4 each
   added `docs/skill-snapshot/SKILL.md`. Distinct wave numbers make the
   collision structurally impossible. Regression proof:
   `tests/test_wave_orchestrator_e2e.py::TestSkillSnapshotNumberedNames`.
2. **Never touch the un-numbered legacy paths** (`docs/skill-snapshot/`
   `SKILL.md`, `REFERENCE.md`, `scripts/…`) from a wave branch — they are
   the frozen pre-#379 snapshots, kept so historical diffs and the
   `tests/test_render_orchestrator_snippet.py` §0-contract checks stay
   valid.
3. **The skill home is the canonical source of truth.** Each
   `<basename>.wave-${WAVE}.md` is a verbatim full copy of the skill-home
   file as of that wave; the highest-numbered snapshot on `origin/develop`
   always reflects the canonical file at that point in history — a
   coherent per-wave lineage instead of N conflicting adds of one path.
4. **Cross-cycle number reuse is safe** because cycles run sequentially:
   a later cycle's wave N finds `<basename>.wave-N.md` already tracked on
   its base and lands an in-place edit (clean rebase), never add/add.

### 3b. Spawn Implementation Sub-agents

Spawn one Task sub-agent per issue using the prompt template in
[REFERENCE.md — Implementation Sub-agent Template](REFERENCE.md#implementation-sub-agent-template).

Each sub-agent implements the fix and pushes the branch. The orchestrator
creates the PR (see Phase 3c § Recovery for the creation logic).

### 3c. Wait + Verify

For each sub-agent in the wave, the orchestrator actively verifies PR creation
instead of passively waiting for a done signal:

**Per-sub-agent verification (parallel for all in wave):**

1. **Hard timeout**: Start a 5-minute timer when the sub-agent is spawned.
   If exceeded, enter the worktree directly, verify state, push if needed,
   and create the PR — bypassing the sub-agent entirely.

1.5. **Pre-PR verification** (after sub-agent reports "done", before polling
    for the PR): verify all changes are committed AND the targeted tests pass
    before the orchestrator creates a PR. Catches the #311-style failure
    mode where a sub-agent reports "done" with uncommitted changes or
    failing tests left in the worktree.
    ```bash
    # Step 1.5: pre-PR verification
    # Verify the sub-agent's worktree has all changes committed + tests pass
    cd ../worktrees/issue-{N}-{slug}
    if [[ -n "$(git status --porcelain)" ]]; then
      echo "Sub-agent left uncommitted changes in worktree; aborting PR creation"
      exit 1
    fi
    # Run the targeted test file(s) and confirm green
    .venv/bin/pytest tests/test_{affected_file}.py -q
    # If this fails, re-spawn a continuation sub-agent with a focused prompt
    ```
    Manual drill: drop an untracked file into a worktree (`touch
    ../worktrees/issue-{N}-{slug}/.junk`) and run the snippet above — the
    `git status --porcelain` check must exit 1 before any `gh pr create`
    is invoked. Catches #311-style incompleteness.

2. **PR verification loop** (while timer is active):
   After the sub-agent reports "done", poll every 10s for up to 60s:
   ```bash
   gh pr list --search "fix/issue-{N}" --json number,title,state --jq '.[] | select(.state=="OPEN") | .number'
   ```
    - **PR found** → record PR number in wave-state.<repo-slug>.json, move to next issue
    - **PR NOT found after 60s** → if `wave-state.<repo-slug>.json` records a prior
      PR number for this issue (status `pr_created`), run the `pr_recreate`
      sub-step below; otherwise enter the recovery sequence.
    - **`pr_recreate` sub-step** (when the previous PR is stuck CLOSED
      because `gh pr reopen` failed after a force-push; issue #364):
      ```bash
      # 1. Look up the prior PR number from wave-state.<repo-slug>.json
      PRIOR_PR=$(jq -r '.issues["{N}"].pr_number // empty' ../worktrees/wave-state.<repo-slug>.json)
      if [ -n "$PRIOR_PR" ]; then
        STATE=$(gh pr view "$PRIOR_PR" --json state --jq '.state')
        if [ "$STATE" = "CLOSED" ]; then
          # 2. Attempt reopen; on failure, recreate the PR (issue #364)
          if ! gh pr reopen "$PRIOR_PR" 2>/dev/null; then
            OLD_TITLE=$(gh pr view "$PRIOR_PR" --json title --jq '.title' 2>/dev/null)
            OLD_BODY=$(gh pr view "$PRIOR_PR" --json body --jq '.body' 2>/dev/null)
            gh pr close "$PRIOR_PR"  # confirm closed
            NEW_PR=$(gh pr create --base develop \
              --title "$OLD_TITLE" \
              --body "$OLD_BODY" \
              --head fix/issue-{N}-{slug} | tail -1 | awk -F'/' '{print $NF}')
            # 3. Update wave-state.<repo-slug>.json with the new PR number
            jq --arg n "{N}" --arg p "$NEW_PR" \
              '.issues[$n].pr_number = ($p | tonumber)' \
              ../worktrees/wave-state.<repo-slug>.json > ../worktrees/wave-state.<repo-slug>.json.tmp \
              && mv ../worktrees/wave-state.<repo-slug>.json.tmp ../worktrees/wave-state.<repo-slug>.json
          fi
        fi
      fi
      ```
     The verification loop re-runs Phase 3c § 4 (PR base) and § 5
     (PR body) on the new PR before recording it.

3. **Recovery sequence** (when PR missing or timeout):
   ```bash
   cd ../worktrees/issue-{N}-{slug}

# Step A: check if branch was pushed
    git fetch origin
    if git branch --list origin/fix/issue-{N}-{slug} > /dev/null 2>&1; then
      # Branch exists remotely — PR was not created
      COMMIT_SUBJECT=$(git log -1 --format=%s)
      if echo "$COMMIT_SUBJECT" | grep -q "resolve #{N}"; then
        BODY_KEYWORD="Closes"
      else
        BODY_KEYWORD="Refs"
      fi
      gh pr create --base develop \
        --title "$COMMIT_SUBJECT" \
        --body "${BODY_KEYWORD} #{N}" \
        --head fix/issue-{N}-{slug}
    else
      # Branch was never pushed — push with idempotent lease
      git push -u origin fix/issue-{N}-{slug} --force-with-lease
      COMMIT_SUBJECT=$(git log -1 --format=%s)
      if echo "$COMMIT_SUBJECT" | grep -q "resolve #{N}"; then
        BODY_KEYWORD="Closes"
      else
        BODY_KEYWORD="Refs"
      fi
      gh pr create --base develop \
        --title "$COMMIT_SUBJECT" \
        --body "${BODY_KEYWORD} #{N}" \
        --head fix/issue-{N}-{slug}
    fi

   # Step B: verify PR was created
   gh pr list --search "fix/issue-{N}" --json number --jq 'length'
   # Must return 1 — if 0, escalate to user with worktree path
   ```

  4. **PR base verification** (after PR is found, before recording it):
     ```bash
     BASE_REF=$(gh pr view {PR_NUMBER} --json baseRefName --jq '.baseRefName')
     if [ "$BASE_REF" != "develop" ]; then
       # Auto-fix: close wrong-base PR and recreate targeting develop
       gh pr close {PR_NUMBER}
       gh pr create --base develop \
         --title "$(gh pr view {PR_NUMBER} --json title --jq '.title')" \
         --body "$(gh pr view {PR_NUMBER} --json body --jq '.body')" \
         --head fix/issue-{N}-{slug}
     fi
     ```
     This catches sub-agents that omit `--base develop` from `gh pr create`.

5. **PR body validation** (after PR is found, before recording it):
      ```bash
      BODY=$(gh pr view {PR_NUMBER} --json body --jq '.body')
      # Determine keyword from commit message: resolve → Closes, refs → Refs
      COMMIT_SUBJECT=$(gh pr view {PR_NUMBER} --json headRefName --jq '.headRefName' | xargs -I{} git log -1 --format=%s origin/{})
      if echo "$COMMIT_SUBJECT" | grep -q "resolve #{N}"; then
        KEYWORD="Closes"
      else
        KEYWORD="Refs"
      fi
      if echo "$BODY" | grep -qE "(Closes|Fixes|Refs|for|touches)\s+#{N}"; then
         # Keyword found — record PR number in wave-state.<repo-slug>.json, move to next issue
         :
       else
         # Auto-fix: append the required keyword to the PR body
         gh pr edit {PR_NUMBER} --body "${BODY}

${KEYWORD} #{N}"
       fi
      if echo "$BODY" | grep -qE "^Scope guard:"; then
        # Scope guard already present — record PR number in wave-state.<repo-slug>.json
        :
      else
        # Auto-fix: append the default scope-guard line (issue #365;
        # fence from issue #301). Set NEXT_ISSUE to the next-priority
        # open issue in the same wave, or leave "#M" as a placeholder
        # the orchestrator substitutes before editing. The shape uses
        # "#M" so the appended block always satisfies all four
        # check_pr_body_scope.sh assertions (keyword, scope guard line,
        # issue reference, rationale phrase).
        NEXT_ISSUE="#M"
        gh pr edit {PR_NUMBER} --body "${BODY}

Scope guard: Do NOT touch any other area of the codebase; ${NEXT_ISSUE} owns the follow-up area."
      fi
      ```
      This catches sub-agents that omit either the `Closes #N` /
      `Fixes #N` / `Refs #N` keyword or the `Scope guard:` line from the PR body
      (issues #2340 and #365 respectively; the Scope guard contract is
      the gate added by #301). The keyword regex accepts both exact
      and whitespace-variant forms (e.g., `Closes  #123`, `Closes#123`);
      the Scope guard regex is anchored at start-of-line (`^Scope
      guard:`) so mentions inside fenced code blocks or prose do not
      false-positive.

  6. **Idempotency**: All orchestrator push commands use `--force-with-lease`.
     All `gh pr create` calls are safe to re-run — GitHub returns error if PR
     already exists for that head branch, but the verification above prevents
     reaching that case.

  7. **Escalation**: If recovery sequence fails or PR still missing after push,
    record issue as `escalated` in wave-state.<repo-slug>.json and report to user with
    worktree path so they can inspect and push manually.

 **Do not proceed to Phase 4 until every PR in the wave exists (on develop) or is escalated.**

## Phase 4: CI and Merge

**Precondition — pre-merge nightly-authority re-check.** Before EVERY
merge (orchestrator-initiated or CI sub-agent), re-run Checkpoint 2 of
[Nightly-Authority Merge Freeze](#nightly-authority-merge-freeze): a red
lane-3 nightly freezes all merges and all new waves for the repo.

**Merge criterion — ALL checks green (interim invariant).** The merge
criterion is ALL checks green (`gh pr checks {N}` exits 0), NOT merely
required-checks green. Some repos temporarily run a reduced required-check
floor on develop (fluxion: issue #3810 tracks restoring branch protection
after the ADR-0016 lane split), so a PR with failing or erroring
non-required checks must NOT merge under the reduced floor. This invariant
survives until #3810 (or the target repo's equivalent) closes.

### 4a. Merge Ordering

Merge PRs in ascending issue-number order within a wave to minimize
conflict surface. After each merge, check remaining PRs for conflicts.
See [REFERENCE.md — Merge Ordering Strategy](REFERENCE.md#merge-ordering-strategy).

### 4b. Spawn CI Sub-agents

Spawn one sub-agent per PR using the prompt template in
[REFERENCE.md — CI Sub-agent Template](REFERENCE.md#ci-sub-agent-template).

Each sub-agent monitors CI, fixes failures, resolves merge conflicts,
and merges the PR.

**Stuck CLOSED + reopen fails → recreate (issue #364):** When a branch is
force-pushed after a rebase, GitHub's PR head reference becomes stale and
`gh pr reopen <N>` fails with `Could not open the pull request. (reopenPullRequest)`.
In that case, recreate the PR instead of escalating:

```bash
if ! gh pr reopen <N> 2>/dev/null; then
  OLD_TITLE=$(gh pr view <N> --json title --jq '.title' 2>/dev/null)
  OLD_BODY=$(gh pr view <N> --json body --jq '.body' 2>/dev/null)
  gh pr close <N>  # confirm closed
  NEW_PR=$(gh pr create --base develop \
    --title "$OLD_TITLE" \
    --body "$OLD_BODY" \
    --head fix/issue-{N}-{slug} | tail -1 | awk -F'/' '{print $NF}')
  # Phase 3c verification loop picks up the new PR on its next poll;
  # update wave-state.<repo-slug>.json with the new number.
fi
```

The recreate path carries over the old title/body verbatim, so re-run
Phase 3c § 4 (PR base) and § 5 (PR body) checks on the new PR before
recording it. The CI sub-agent template keeps `gh pr close && gh pr
reopen` as the primary retrigger; the recreate flow above is the
fallback for the stale-head case (replaces the prior "escalate on
reopen failure" behavior with an automatic recovery).

### 4c. Issue Close Verification

After each PR merge, the CI sub-agent runs two steps in this order
(issues #961, #366):

1. **Auto-close** — `python3 scripts/auto_close_issues.py <PR_NUMBER>`
   closes every `Closes #N` / `Fixes #N` / `Resolves #N` reference in the
   PR body that GitHub left OPEN (GitHub only auto-closes the FIRST
   reference on a comma-separated line).
2. **Verify** — `bash scripts/verify_issues_closed.sh <PR_NUMBER>`
   confirms every referenced issue is now CLOSED.

Order matters: auto-close first so verification only fails on issues the
automation genuinely could not close. If any linked issue is still open
after both steps, the sub-agent reports BLOCKER and stops instead of
proceeding.

`scripts/auto_close_issues.py` lives in the project repo and is the
primary path. The skill-home copy of `scripts/verify_issues_closed.sh` is
kept as a self-contained fallback for repos that do not ship the Python
helper.

### 4d. Wait

Monitor until ALL PRs in the wave are merged (or escalated).
Then clean up worktrees: `git worktree prune`

## Nightly-Authority Merge Freeze

Some repos (fluxion under ADR-0016) delegate slow authority checks —
determinism, performance gates, coverage, security — to scheduled nightly
workflows on `develop` instead of per-PR CI. When a nightly is red, per-PR
green is NOT sufficient authority to merge: the base branch itself is
suspect. The freeze has two checkpoints and one diagnostic path.

**Lane-3 workflow set (fluxion):** `nightly-ashrae-140-gauge.yml`,
`determinism_check.yml`, `performance_dashboard.yml`, `code-coverage.yml`,
`security.yml`. Keep the skill repo-agnostic: apply the check to the target
repo's scheduled-authority workflows; a workflow that does not exist in
the repo is skipped, and a repo with none skips the freeze entirely.

### Checkpoint 1 — wave start

Before starting any wave, check the most recent COMPLETED nightly run of
each lane-3 workflow on develop:

```bash
gh run list --workflow <workflow-file> --branch develop --status completed --limit 1 \
  --json conclusion,displayTitle,createdAt
```

If ANY conclusion is `failure`, the wave does not start — treat it as a
freeze and run the freeze protocol below.

### Checkpoint 2 — before each merge

Re-run the same check immediately before EVERY merge, in the orchestrator
and in each CI sub-agent (the CI Sub-agent Template embeds this step). A
red nightly ⇒ FREEZE:

- **No merges** — even PRs whose own checks are all green.
- **No new waves** — do not proceed to Phase 5 while frozen.
- **Spawn exactly ONE freeze-breaker sub-agent** (below). Do not spawn
  fixers per PR: the failure lives on develop, not on any single PR.

### Freeze-breaker sub-agent

Exactly one diagnostic sub-agent for the whole frozen wave — never one per
PR. Inputs:

- The failing workflow name and run id.
- `gh run view <run-id> --log-failed` output for that run.
- Develop merges since that workflow's last green nightly:
  ```bash
  gh run list --workflow <workflow-file> --branch develop --status success \
    --limit 1 --json headSha,createdAt
  git log --oneline <last-green-sha>..origin/develop
  ```

Mandate: diagnose only — identify which merge (or nightly-environment
change) broke the workflow and propose the revert/fix; do not implement
changes beyond the diagnostic. The freeze-breaker consumes the wave's
milestone slot: the reserved `milestone` issue is not executed while
frozen (it returns to supply for the next wave once the freeze lifts).

Notify the user per the Communication Rules "stuck" clause — a frozen wave
IS a stuck wave; report the failing workflow, run id, and the
freeze-breaker's findings.

The freeze lifts only when the failing workflow's most recent COMPLETED
run on develop is green again (re-verify via Checkpoint 1).

## Phase 5: Next Wave

Repeat Phase 3–4 for the next wave. Do not start the next wave while a
nightly-authority freeze is active (see Nightly-Authority Merge Freeze),
and do not start one on a plan whose wave-mix deferred list is non-empty
without new milestone supply.
After the final wave, report summary:

```
WAVE ORCHESTRATION COMPLETE
===========================
Total issues: {N} | Waves: {count}
Merged: {count} | Escalated: {count} | Skipped: {count}
```

## Decision Protocol (Foreman MCP)

Whenever the orchestrator or its sub-agents encounter an ambiguous situation, blocker, plan approval, or decision point that would normally require asking the human operator for input, **always query the Foreman MCP first** using the `ask_foreman` tool.

### Tool Invocation Schema
```json
{
  "question": "<Clear, concise decision question as would be asked to the human>",
  "options": ["<Option 1>", "<Option 2>", "..."],
  "context": "<Detailed context: issue/PR numbers, error outputs, attempted fixes, tradeoffs>",
  "risk_hint": "<Advisory hint, e.g. 'merge conflict', 'CI failure', 'plan approval', 'freeze'>",
  "min_confidence": 0.7
}
```

### Protocol Rules
1. **Foreman First**: Call `ask_foreman` before any escalation, confirmation prompt, or question to the human operator.
2. **Handle Answered**: If Foreman returns `{"status": "answered", "choice": "...", "rationale": "..."}`, log the decision and rationale in the state file / journal and proceed immediately with that choice without interrupting the human.
3. **Handle Abstained / Fallback**: If Foreman returns `{"status": "abstained", "rationale": "..."}` or the Foreman MCP is unreachable/errors, only then fall back to asking the human operator, providing the options and Foreman's rationale for full context.

### Key Decision Points Handled by Foreman
- **Wave Plan Approval (Phase 2)**: Approving wave groupings when not in `--auto` mode.
- **Merge Conflict Strategy (Phase 3c / 4)**: Deciding whether to adopt branch changes, adopt develop changes, attempt manual semantic rebase, or escalate.
- **Persistent CI Failures (Phase 3c / 4)**: Deciding whether to retry with a clean worktree, skip the issue to preserve wave progress, use `--admin` merge if locally verified, or escalate.
- **Nightly-Authority Freezes (Phase 4)**: Deciding whether to spawn a freeze-breaker, wait for a scheduled re-run, or halt the pipeline.

## Communication Rules

- **Silent during execution.** No play-by-play updates.
- **Always consult Foreman MCP (`ask_foreman`) first** on any decision, blocker, or approval before contacting the human.
- **Update the user only when:**
  - Wave plan is ready for review (Phase 2) — **only when NOT in --auto mode AND Foreman abstained**
  - A wave completes and the next begins
  - A sub-agent is stuck or CI cannot be fixed after max retries — **only after Foreman abstained or selected escalation**
  - The pipeline HALTS: wave-mix milestone supply exhausted (Phase 2
    `WAVE-MIX HALT` or a non-empty `plan.deferred`), or a
    nightly-authority freeze is active (red lane-3 nightly on develop) — **only after Foreman confirms halting**
  - A merge conflict requires human resolution (non-auto-resolvable) — **only after Foreman abstained on auto-resolution strategy**
  - The user asks a direct question

**When --auto flag is passed:** All wave execution proceeds autonomously. The wave plan is written to the state file for post-hoc audit. Merge conflicts that cannot be auto-resolved (even after querying Foreman) are recorded as `escalated` in the state file and the wave continues with remaining issues.

## Resume

If interrupted mid-wave, the orchestrator reads the namespaced state file
`../worktrees/wave-state.<repo-slug>.json` (where `<repo-slug>` is derived from
`git remote get-url origin`, e.g. `openstudio-server-operator`) to detect
in-progress work and resumes from the last incomplete phase.

**Backward compatibility (one release):** If the namespaced file does not exist,
the orchestrator falls back to the legacy `../worktrees/wave-state.json` and
emits a deprecation warning. The legacy path will be removed in a future release.

**Mid-flight collision recovery (issue #3145):** If the orchestrator detects
that its state file has been overwritten by a different repo's run mid-wave,
follow the archive convention: move the stale state to
`wave-state.<repo>-archived-<YYYY-MM-DD>.json` (the date is `UTC` of the
overwrite detection) and re-run the wave from a fresh namespaced file. The
archive convention is intentionally not automated — the operator confirms
which state is stale before archiving, because both repos may have written
to the same path legitimately during a forced merge.
